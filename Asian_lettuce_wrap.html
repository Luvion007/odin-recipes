    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      These lettuce wraps are bursting with Asian flavors, delicious, and a
      great idea for entertaining or a family-style meal. To serve, allow each
      person to spoon a portion of the beef mixture into a lettuce leaf. Wrap
      the lettuce around the beef like a burrito and enjoy!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredient</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>16 Boston Bibb or butter lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step by Step instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse whole lettuce leaves and pat dry, being careful not to tear them;
        set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef; cook and
        stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard
        grease; transfer beef to a bowl. Add onion to the same skillet; cook and
        stir until just tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in hoisin sauce, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, and chile
        pepper sauce until well combined. Add water chestnuts, green onions,
        sesame oil, and cooked beef; cook and stir until the onions just begin
        to wilt, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange lettuce leaves around the outer edge of a large serving platter;
        spoon beef mixture in the center.
      </li>
    </ol>
